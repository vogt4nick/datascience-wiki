### How Are Data Scientists Different From Data Analysts?

Broadly speaking, the roles differ in scope: data analysts build reports with narrow, well-defined KPIs. Data scientists often to work on broader business problems without clear solutions. Data scientists live on the edge of the known and unknown.

We'll leave you with a concrete example: A data analyst cares about profit margins. A data scientist at the same company cares about market share.

### Is The Data Science Job Market Saturated?

[Quoting /u/drhorn](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/aqvr76/glut_or_shortage/egiwqd7),

> There's a glut of fresh out of college people who know textbook data science.  
> There is a huge shortage of established, experienced data scientists who have experience with real world problems.  
> The former group think that experience is overrated. The second group (and most people who are hiring) do not.

### How will data science evolve in the next 5 years?

### Will AI replace data scientists?

### What is the workday like for a data scientist?

It's common for data scientists across the US to work 40 hours weekly. While company culture does dictate different levels of work life balance, it's rare to see data scientists who work more than they want. That's the virtue of being an expensive resource in a competitive job market.

## Learning

> I want to become a data scientist. How do I make it a reality?  

### How do I become a Data Scientist?

The roadmap given to aspiring data scientists can be boiled down to three steps:  

1. Earning an undergraduate and/or advanced degree in computer science, statistics, or mathematics,  
2. Building their portfolio of SQL, Python, and R skills, and  
3. Getting related work experience through technical internships.  

All three require a significant time and financial commitment.

There used to be a saying around /r/datascience: The road into a data science starts with two years of university-level math.

### What Should I Learn? What Order Do I Learn Them?

This answer assumes your academic background ends with a HS diploma in the US.

1. Python
2. Differential Calculus
3. Integral Calculus
4. Multivariable Calculus
5. Linear Algebra
6. Probability
7. Statistics

Some follow up questions and answers:

__Why Python first?__

- Python is a general purpose language. R is used primarily by statisticians. In the likely scenario that you decide data science requires too much time, effort, and money, Python will be more valuable than your R skills. It's preparing you to fail, sure, but in the same way a savings account is preparing you to fail.

__When do I start working with data?__

- You'll start working with data when you've learned enough Python to do so. Whether you'll have the tools to have any fun is a much more open-ended question.  

__How long will this take me?__

- Assuming self-study and average intelligence, 3-5 years from start to finish.

### How Do I Learn...

__How Do I Learn Python?__

If you don't know the first thing about programming, start with MIT's course in the curated list.

These modules are the standard tools for data analysis in Python:

- `pandas` (and by extension, `numpy`)
    - Check out [Minimally Sufficient Pandas](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/alhmp1/minimally_sufficient_pandas/) for style guides and best practices.
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn`
    - [See /u/rhiever's response to How do you decide between the plotting libraries: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Bokeh?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/4tuwoz/how_do_you_decide_between_the_plotting_libraries/d5kyyk6)
    - Don't worry about bokeh or dash unless you have a personal interest in interactive visualizations.
- `scipy` and `scikit-learn`
    - Internalize the `.fit()` and `.predict()` pattern.

    - Related to pythonprogramming.net  
4. /r/learnpython is an active sub and very useful for learning the basics.

__How Do I Learn R?__

If you don't know the first thing about programming, start with R for Data Science in the curated list.

These modules are the standard tools for data analysis in Python:

2. [Data Scientist with R Career Track | DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/data-scientist-with-r)
    - The first courses are free, but unlimited access costs $29/month. Users usually report a positive experience, and it's one of the few hands-on ways to learn R.
3. [R Inferno](https://www.burns-stat.com/pages/Tutor/R_inferno.pdf)
    - Learners with a CS background will appreciate this free handbook explaining how and why R behaves the way that it does.  

__How Do I Learn SQL?__

Prioritize the basics of SQL. i.e. when to use functions like `POW`, `SUM`, `RANK`; the computational complexity of the different kinds of joins.

Concepts like relational algebra, when to use clustered/non-clustered indexes, etc. are useful, but (almost) never come up in interviews. 

You absolutely do not need to understand administrative concepts like managing permissions.

Finally, [there are numerous query engines](https://i.imgur.com/WIIHmmm.mp4) and therefore numerous dialects of SQL. Use whichever dialect is supported in your chosen resource. There's not much difference between them, so it's easy to learn another dialect after you've learned one.

__How Do I Learn Calculus?__

Fortunately (or unfortunately), calculus is the lament of many students, and so resources for it are plentiful. Khan Academy mimics lectures very well, and Paul's Online Math Notes are a terrific reference full of practice problems and solutions.

Calculus, however, is not just calculus. For those unfamiliar with US terminology, 

- Calculus I is differential calculus.
- Calculus II is integral calculus. 
- Calculus III is multivariable calculus. 
- Calculus IV is differential equations. 

Differential and integral calculus are both necessary for probability and statistics, and should be completed first.

Multivariable calculus can be paired with linear algebra, but is also required.  

Differential equations is where consensus falls apart. The short it is, they're all but necessary for mathematical modeling, but not everyone does mathematical modeling. It's another tool in the toolbox.

__How Do I Learn Probability?__

Probability is not friendly to beginners. Definitions are rooted in higher mathematics, notation varies from source to source, and solutions are frequently unintuitive. Probability may present the biggest barrier to entry in data science.

It's best to pick a single primary source and a community for help. If you can spend the money, register for a university or community college course and attend in person.

The best free resource is [MIT's 18.05 Introduction to Probability and Statistics (Spring 2014)](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-05-introduction-to-probability-and-statistics-spring-2014/).

### Should I Go to Grad School?

/u/drhorn said it best in [Want to pursue career in Data Science, need advice](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/6gqx2q/want_to_pursue_career_in_data_science_need_advice/dit1zkx):

> If you can find a job doing data-related work that you enjoy, don't go to grad school; continue to work and teach yourself whatever you need (or want) to learn.  
> If you are not being considered for jobs that you actually want to do - and the reason is that you don't have a background that is classically found in data science - then you may want to consider grad school as a safer route to be qualified for said jobs.

### Should I Get AWS Certifications? Which Ones?

The consensus is that certifications are unnecessary for data scientist positions.

Per /u/charlie_datacamp,

> I've spent the past few months talking to hiring managers and recruiters in data science. Not a single one of them has mentioned certificates even once. I literally have hours and hours of interview tapes with DS recruiters and hiring managers, 100% of the conversation was about data science job applications and hiring, and literally zero times did any of them mention certificates, or say they're impressed by this or that certificate, or wanting to see certificates.

### What does the typical data science interview process look like?

For general advice, [Mastering the DS Interview Loop](https://towardsdatascience.com/mastering-the-data-science-interview-15f9c0a558a7) is a terrific article. The community [discussed the article here](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/air0nf/mastering_the_data_science_interview_loop/).  

Briefly summarized, most companies follow a five stage process:  

1. Coding Challenge  
    - Most common at software companies and roles contributing to a digital product.  
2. HR Screen  
3. Technical Screen  
    - Often in the form of a project. Less frequently, it takes the form of a whiteboarding session at the onsite.  
4. Onsite  
    - Usually the project from the technical screen is presented here, followed by a meeting with the director overseeing the team you'll join.  
5. Negotiation & Offer  

Advice specific to Facebook, Zillow, and other companies follows below.
