## MOOCs

There are a couple of really excellent online lectures to get you started.
The list is too long to include them all. Every one of the major MOOC sites offers
not only one but several good Machine Learning classes, so please check
 [coursera](https://www.coursera.org/), [edX](https://www.edx.org/), 
 [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) yourself to see which ones are interesting to you.

Below are a few that stand out, either because they are introductory courses, they're very popular, or are done by people who are famous for their work in machine learning. Roughly in order from easiest to hardest:

* [Intro to Data Science](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud359): The Introduction to Data Science class will survey the foundational topics in data science, namely: Data Manipulation, Data Analysis with Statistics and Machine Learning, Data Communication with Information Visualization, & Data at Scale -- Working with Big Data.

* [Data Analysis with R](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud651): Exploratory data analysis is an approach for summarizing and visualizing the important characteristics of a data set. Promoted by John Tukey, exploratory data analysis focuses on exploring data to understand the data’s underlying structure and variables, to develop intuition about the data set, to consider how that data set came into existence, and to decide how it can be investigated with more formal statistical methods.

* Andrew Ng's [ML-Class at Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/course/ml): Focused on application of techniques. Easy to understand, but mathematically very shallow. Good for beginners!

* Hastie/Tibshirani's [Statistical Learning](https://class.stanford.edu/courses/HumanitiesandScience/StatLearning/Winter2015/about): Aimed at beginners and as a precursor to their "Elements of Statistical Learning" class.

* Hastie/Tibshirani's [Elements of Statistical Learning](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/): Also aimed at beginners and focused more on applications.

* Yaser Abu-Mostafa's [Learning From Data](https://www.edx.org/course/caltechx/caltechx-cs1156x-learning-data-1120):
 Focuses a lot more on theory, but also doable for beginners

## Blogs

Blogs are easiest to follow through free personal aggregators [like feedly](https://feedly.com/). You can add whichever blogs you choose.

We've curated a handful of our preferred bloggers covering a breadth of topics. A longer, curated list follows where you will find content aggregators, some journals, and more individual contributors.

### Essential Bloggers & Aggregators

[Andrew Gelman | Statistical Modeling, Causal Inference, and Social Science](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/)  

- Gelman is (in)famous for his critiques of statistical malpractice. Gelman is also one of the most influential Bayesians in statistics today.  

[Distill](https://distill.pub/)

- Distill does more than teach the essentials the data science toolkit; they teach something more rare: intuition. Interactive visualizations are sure to spark your curiosity. Unfortunately for us, Distill publishes new content once monthly at the best of times.

[Explained Visually](http://setosa.io/ev/)

- While no longer publishing, EV hosts similar content to Distill and deserves a mention on the shortlist.

[Data Science Weekly](https://www.datascienceweekly.org/)

- DS Weekly is actually a weekly e-newsletter curated by Sebastian Gutierrez and Hannah Brooks. Its [archive](https://www.datascienceweekly.org/newsletters) is hard to parse, but is rich in content.

[Simply Statistics](https://simplystatistics.org/)  

- Despite the name, Simply Statistics evolved into a general data science blog over time. Content 

[The Upshot | The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/section/upshot)

- _The Upshot_ is regarded by many as unquestioned leader in data journalism. Articles are topical and deftly illustrate how to use data and charts to tell a story.  

[FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/)

- _FiveThirtyEight_ founder, Nate Silver, arguably invented data journalism in the early 2000s. Flush with content across politics, sports, economics, and more.

### Additional Blogs

- [Vicki Boykis](https://veekaybee.github.io/)  
    - Vicki is a rising star in the blogosphere. Her writing is easy to read and often adds insightful commentary to modern problems in data science.
- [R-Bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/)
    - Readers will drown in content if they aren't careful.
- [Julia Bloggers](https://www.juliabloggers.com/)
    - Infrequently updated, but the archive may be of interest to fans of Julia. 
- [Towards Data Science](http://towardsdatascience.com/)
    - A content aggregator that varies in quality.  
- [DataTau](https://www.datatau.com/)
    - A content aggregator that varies in quality.  
- [DataCamp Blog](https://www.datacamp.com/community/blog)
    - Writes to a beginner audience. Professionals may find it tedious.
